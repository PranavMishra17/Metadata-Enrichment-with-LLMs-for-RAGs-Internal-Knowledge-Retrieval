AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure, AWS services,\nAPIs, and tools to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly\nconsistent hybrid experience. AWS Outposts is ideal for workloads that require low-latency access\nto on-premises systems, local data processing, data residency, and migration of applications with\nlocal system interdependencies. For more information, see What is AWS Outposts? in the AWS\nOutposts User Guide. With Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your Outposts and easily store and\nretrieve objects on premises. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, OUTPOSTS, which uses\nthe Amazon S3 APIs and is designed to store data durably and redundantly across multiple devices\nand servers on your Outposts. You communicate with your Outposts bucket by using an access\npoint and endpoint connection over a virtual private cloud (VPC). You can use the same APIs and features on Outposts buckets as you do on Amazon S3,\nincluding access policies, encryption, and tagging. You can use S3 on Outposts through the AWS\nManagement Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. \u2022 How S3 on Outposts works\n\u2022 Features of S3 on Outposts\n\u2022 Related services\n\u2022 Accessing S3 on Outposts\n\u2022 Paying for S3 on Outposts\n\u2022 Next steps\nHow S3 on Outposts works\nS3 on Outposts is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets on your\nOutpost. An object is a data file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for\nobjects. To store your data in S3 on Outposts, you first create a bucket. When you create the bucket, you\nspecify a bucket name and the Outpost that will hold the bucket. To access your S3 on Outposts\nbucket and perform object operations, you next create and configure an access point. You must\nalso create an endpoint to route requests to your access point. How S3 on Outposts works API Version 2006-03-01 1\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nAccess points simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores data\nin S3. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets and can be used\nto perform object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject. Each access point has distinct\npermissions and network controls. You can create and manage your S3 on Outposts buckets, access points, and endpoints by using\nthe AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API. To upload and manage objects in\nyour S3 on Outposts bucket, you can use the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API. Regions\nDuring AWS Outposts provisioning, you or AWS creates a service link connection that connects\nyour Outpost back to your chosen AWS Region or Outposts home Region for bucket operations and\ntelemetry. An Outpost relies on connectivity to the parent AWS Region. The Outposts rack is not\ndesigned for disconnected operations or environments with limited to no connectivity. For more\ninformation, see Outpost connectivity to AWS Regions in the AWS Outposts User Guide. Buckets\nA bucket is a container for objects stored in S3 on Outposts. You can store any number of objects in\na bucket and can have up to 100 buckets per account per Outpost. When you create a bucket, you enter a bucket name and choose the Outpost where the bucket\nwill reside. After you create a bucket, you cannot change the bucket name or move the bucket to a\ndifferent Outpost. Bucket names must follow Amazon S3 bucket naming rules. In S3 on Outposts,\nbucket names are unique to an Outpost and AWS account. S3 on Outposts buckets require the\noutpost-id, account-id, and bucket name to identify them. The following example shows the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for S3 on Outposts\nbuckets. The ARN is comprised of the Region your Outpost is homed to, your Outpost account, the\nOutpost ID, and the bucket name. arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/bucket/bucket-name\nEvery object is contained in a bucket. You must use access points to access any object in an\nOutposts bucket. When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the access point ARN\nor access point alias. For more information about access point aliases, see Using a bucket-style alias\nfor your S3 on Outposts bucket access point. Regions API Version 2006-03-01 2\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nThe following example shows the access point ARN format for S3 on Outposts, which includes the\noutpost-id, account-id, and access point name:\narn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name\nFor more information about buckets, see Working with S3 on Outposts buckets. Objects\nObjects are the fundamental entities stored in S3 on Outposts. Objects consist of object data and\nmetadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These pairs include\nsome default metadata, such as the date last modified, and standard HTTP metadata, such as\nContent-Type. You can also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored. An\nobject is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (or name). With Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost. When AWS installs an\nOutpost rack, your data stays local to your Outpost to meet data-residency requirements. Your\nobjects never leave your Outpost and are not in an AWS Region. Because the AWS Management\nConsole is hosted in-Region, you can't use the console to upload or manage objects in your\nOutpost. However, you can use the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS\nSDKs to upload and manage your objects through your access points. Keys\nAn object key (or key name) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a\nbucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket and object key uniquely identifies each\nobject. The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts objects, which includes the AWS\nRegion code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to, AWS account ID, Outpost ID, bucket\nname, and object key:\narn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/ op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/amzn-\ns3-demo-bucket1/object/myobject\nFor more information about object keys, see Working with S3 on Outposts objects. Objects API Version 2006-03-01 3\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nS3 Versioning\nYou can use S3 Versioning on Outposts buckets to keep multiple variants of an object in the\nsame bucket. With S3 Versioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every\nobject stored in your buckets. S3 Versioning helps you recover from unintended user actions and\napplication failures. For more information, see Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket. Version ID\nWhen you enable S3 Versioning in a bucket, S3 on Outposts generates a unique version ID for\neach object added to the bucket. Objects that already existed in the bucket at the time that you\nenable versioning have a version ID of null. If you modify these (or any other) objects with other\noperations, such as PutObject, the new objects get a unique version ID. For more information, see Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket. Storage class and encryption\nS3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts (OUTPOSTS). The S3 Outposts storage\nclass is available only for objects stored in buckets on AWS Outposts. If you try to use other S3\nstorage classes with S3 on Outposts, S3 on Outposts returns the InvalidStorageClass error. By default, objects stored in the S3 Outposts (OUTPOSTS) storage class are encrypted using server-\nside encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). For more information, see\nData encryption in S3 on Outposts. Bucket policy\nA bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you\ncan use to grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner can\nassociate a policy with a bucket. The permissions attached to the bucket apply to all of the objects\nin the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner. Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size. Bucket policies use JSON-based IAM policy language that is standard across AWS. You can use\nbucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a bucket. Bucket policies allow or deny\nrequests based on the elements in the policy. These elements can include the requester, S3 on\nOutposts actions, resources, and aspects or conditions of the request (for example, the IP address\nS3 Versioning API Version 2006-03-01 4\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nused to make the request). For example, you can create a bucket policy that grants cross-account\npermissions to upload objects to an S3 on Outposts bucket while ensuring that the bucket owner\nhas full control of the uploaded objects. In your bucket policy, you can use wildcard characters (*) in ARNs and other values to grant\npermissions to a subset of objects. For example, you can control access to groups of objects that\nbegin with a common prefix or end with a given extension, such as .html. S3 on Outposts access points\nS3 on Outposts access points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that\ndescribe how data can be accessed using that endpoint. Access points simplify managing data\naccess at scale for shared datasets in S3 on Outposts. Access points are attached to buckets that\nyou can use to perform S3 object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject. When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the access point ARN or access point\nalias. For more information about access point aliases, see Using a bucket-style alias for your S3 on\nOutposts bucket access point. Access points have distinct permissions and network controls that S3 on Outposts applies for any\nrequest that is made through that access point. Each access point enforces a customized access\npoint policy that works in conjunction with the bucket policy that is attached to the underlying\nbucket. For more information, see Accessing your S3 on Outposts buckets and objects. Features of S3 on Outposts\nAccess management\nS3 on Outposts provides features for auditing and managing access to your buckets and objects. By\ndefault, S3 on Outposts buckets and the objects in them are private. You have access only to the S3\non Outposts resources that you create. To grant granular resource permissions that support your specific use case or to audit the\npermissions of your S3 on Outposts resources, you can use the following features. \u2022 S3 Block Public Access \u2013 Block public access to buckets and objects. For buckets on Outposts,\nBlock Public Access is always enabled by default. S3 on Outposts access points API Version 2006-03-01 5\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n\u2022 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) \u2013 IAM is a web service that helps you securely\ncontrol access to AWS resources, including your S3 on Outposts resources. With IAM, you can\ncentrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to\ncontrol who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. \u2022 S3 on Outposts access points \u2013 Manage data access for shared datasets in S3 on Outposts. Access\npoints are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies. Access points are attached\nto buckets and can be used to perform object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject. \u2022 Bucket policies \u2013 Use IAM-based policy language to configure resource-based permissions for\nyour S3 buckets and the objects in them. \u2022 AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) \u2013 Securely share your S3 on Outposts capacity across\nAWS accounts, within your organization or organizational units (OUs) in AWS Organizations. Storage logging and monitoring\nS3 on Outposts provides logging and monitoring tools that you can use to monitor and control\nhow your S3 on Outposts resources are being used. For more information, see Monitoring tools. \u2022 Amazon CloudWatch metrics for S3 on Outposts \u2013 Track the operational health of your\nresources and understand your capacity availability. \u2022 Amazon CloudWatch Events events for S3 on Outposts \u2013 Create a rule for any S3 on Outposts\nAPI event to receive notifications through all supported CloudWatch Events targets, including\nAmazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon\nSNS), and AWS Lambda. \u2022 AWS CloudTrail logs for S3 on Outposts \u2013 Record actions taken by a user, a role, or an AWS\nservice in S3 on Outposts. CloudTrail logs provide you with detailed API tracking for S3 bucket-\nlevel and object-level operations. Strong consistency\nS3 on Outposts provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUT and DELETE requests of\nobjects in your S3 on Outposts bucket in all AWS Regions. This behavior applies to both writes\nof new objects and to PUT requests that overwrite existing objects and to DELETE requests. In\naddition, S3 on Outposts object tags and object metadata (for example, the HEAD object) are\nstrongly consistent. For more information, see Amazon S3 data consistency model in the Amazon\nS3 User Guide. Storage logging and monitoring API Version 2006-03-01 6\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nRelated services\nAfter you load your data into S3 on Outposts, you can use it with other AWS services. The following\nare the services that you might use most frequently:\n\u2022 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) \u2013 Provides secure and scalable computing capacity\nin the AWS Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 lessens your need to invest in hardware up front, so you\ncan develop and deploy applications faster.

Cross-account elastic network interfaces\nS3 on Outposts endpoints are named resources with Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). When these\nendpoints are created, AWS Outposts sets up multiple cross-account elastic network interfaces. S3\non Outposts cross-account elastic network interfaces are like other network interfaces with one\nexception: S3 on Outposts associates the cross-account elastic network interfaces to Amazon EC2\ninstances. The S3 on Outposts Domain Name System (DNS) load balances your requests over the cross-\naccount elastic network interface. S3 on Outposts creates the cross-account elastic network\ninterface in your AWS account that is visible from the Network interfaces pane of the Amazon EC2\nconsole. For endpoints that use the CoIP pool access type, S3 on Outposts allocates and associates IP\naddresses with the cross-account elastic network interface from the configured CoIP pool. Managing connections using cross-account elastic network interfaces API Version 2006-03-01 24\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nWorking with S3 on Outposts buckets\nWith Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily\nstore and retrieve objects on premises for applications that require local data access, local\ndata processing, and data residency. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts\n(OUTPOSTS), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store data durably and\nredundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts. You can use the same APIs\nand features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3, including access policies, encryption,\nand tagging. For more information, see What is Amazon S3 on Outposts? You communicate with your Outpost buckets by using an access point and endpoint connection\nover a virtual private cloud (VPC). To access your S3 on Outposts buckets and objects, you must\nhave an access point for the VPC and an endpoint for the same VPC. For more information, see\nNetworking for S3 on Outposts. Buckets\nIn S3 on Outposts, bucket names are unique to an Outpost and require the AWS Region code for\nthe Region the Outpost is homed to, AWS account ID, Outpost ID, and the bucket name to identify\nthem. arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/bucket/bucket-name\nFor more information, see Resource ARNs for S3 on Outposts. Access points\nAmazon S3 on Outposts supports virtual private cloud (VPC)-only access points as the only means\nto access your Outposts buckets. Access points simplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets in Amazon S3. Access\npoints are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform\nAmazon S3 object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject. With S3 on Outposts, you\nmust use access points to access any object in an Outposts bucket. Access points support only\nvirtual-host-style addressing. Buckets API Version 2006-03-01 25\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nThe following example shows the ARN format that you use for S3 on Outposts access points. The\naccess point ARN includes the AWS Region code for the Region the Outpost is homed to, AWS\naccount ID, Outpost ID, and access point name. arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name\nEndpoints\nTo route requests to an S3 on Outposts access point, you must create and configure an S3 on\nOutposts endpoint. With S3 on Outposts endpoints, you can privately connect your VPC to your\nOutpost bucket. S3 on Outposts endpoints are virtual uniform resource identifiers (URIs) of the\nentry point to your S3 on Outposts bucket. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly\navailable VPC components. Each virtual private cloud (VPC) on your Outpost can have one associated endpoint, and you can\nhave up to 100 endpoints per Outpost. You must create these endpoints to be able to access your\nOutpost buckets and perform object operations. Creating these endpoints also enables the API\nmodel and behaviors to be the same by allowing the same operations to work in S3 and S3 on\nOutposts. API operations on S3 on Outposts\nTo manage Outpost bucket API operations, S3 on Outposts hosts a separate endpoint that is\ndistinct from the Amazon S3 endpoint. This endpoint is s3-outposts.region.amazonaws.com. To use Amazon S3 API operations, you must sign the bucket and objects using the correct ARN\nformat. You must pass ARNs to API operations so that Amazon S3 can determine whether the\nrequest is for Amazon S3 (s3-control.region.amazonaws.com) or for S3 on Outposts (s3-\noutposts.region.amazonaws.com). Based on the ARN format, S3 can then sign and route the\nrequest appropriately. Whenever a request is sent to the Amazon S3 control plane, the SDK extracts the components from\nthe ARN and includes the additional header x-amz-outpost-id, with the outpost-id value\nextracted from the ARN. The service name from the ARN is used to sign the request before it is\nrouted to the S3 on Outposts endpoint. This behavior applies to all API operations handled by the\ns3control client. Endpoints API Version 2006-03-01 26\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nThe following table lists the extended API operations for Amazon S3 on Outposts and their\nchanges relative to Amazon S3.

Creating an S3 on Outposts bucket\nWith Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily\nstore and retrieve objects on premises for applications that require local data access, local\ndata processing, and data residency. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts\n(OUTPOSTS), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store data durably and\nredundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts. You communicate with\nyour Outpost bucket by using an access point and endpoint connection over a virtual private\ncloud (VPC). You can use the same APIs and features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3\nbuckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging. You can use S3 on Outposts through\nthe AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. For more information, see What is Amazon S3 on Outposts? Note\nThe AWS account that creates the bucket owns it and is the only one that can commit\nactions to it. Buckets have configuration properties, such as Outpost, tag, default\nencryption, and access point settings. The access point settings include the virtual private\ncloud (VPC), the access point policy for accessing the objects in the bucket, and other\nmetadata. For more information, see S3 on Outposts specifications. If you want to create a bucket that uses AWS PrivateLink to provide bucket and endpoint\nmanagement access through interface VPC endpoints in your virtual private cloud (VPC), see\nAWS PrivateLink for S3 on Outposts.

Deleting a bucket policy API Version 2006-03-01 37\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nUsing the AWS CLI\nThe following example deletes the bucket policy for an S3 on Outposts bucket (s3-\noutposts:DeleteBucket) by using the AWS CLI. To run this command, replace the user input\nplaceholders with your own information. aws s3control delete-bucket-policy --account-id 123456789012 --bucket arn:aws:s3-\noutposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outposts-\nbucket\nBucket policy examples\nWith S3 on Outposts bucket policies, you can secure access to objects in your S3 on Outposts\nbuckets, so that only users with the appropriate permissions can access them. You can even prevent\nauthenticated users without the appropriate permissions from accessing your S3 on Outposts\nresources. This section presents examples of typical use cases for S3 on Outposts bucket policies. To test\nthese policies, replace the user input placeholders with your own information (such as your\nbucket name). To grant or deny permissions to a set of objects, you can use wildcard characters (*) in Amazon\nResource Names (ARNs) and other values. For example, you can control access to groups of objects\nthat begin with a common prefix or end with a given extension, such as .html. For more information about AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language, see\nSetting up IAM with S3 on Outposts. Note\nWhen testing s3outposts permissions by using the Amazon S3 console, you must grant\nadditional permissions that the console requires, such as s3outposts:createendpoint,\ns3outposts:listendpoints, and so on.

Bucket policy examples API Version 2006-03-01 38\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n\u2022 For guidance on creating your S3 on Outposts policy, see Adding or editing a bucket policy for an\nAmazon S3 on Outposts bucket. Topics\n\u2022 Managing access to an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket based on specific IP addresses\nManaging access to an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket based on specific IP\naddresses\nA bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you\ncan use to grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner can\nassociate a policy with a bucket. The permissions attached to the bucket apply to all of the objects\nin the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner. Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size. For\nmore information, see Bucket policy. Restrict access to specific IP addresses\nThe following example denies all users from performing any S3 on Outposts operations on objects\nin the specified buckets unless the request originates from the specified range of IP addresses. Note\nWhen restricting access to a specific IP address, make sure that you also specify which VPC\nendpoints, VPC source IP addresses, or external IP addresses can access the S3 on Outposts\nbucket. Otherwise, you might lose access to the bucket if your policy denies all users from\nperforming any s3outposts operations on objects in your S3 on Outposts bucket without\nthe proper permissions already in place. This policy's Condition statement identifies 192.0.2.0/24 as the range of allowed IP version 4\n(IPv4) IP addresses. The Condition block uses the NotIpAddress condition and the aws:SourceIp condition key,\nwhich is an AWS wide condition key. The aws:SourceIp condition key can only be used for public\nIP address ranges. For more information about these condition keys, see Actions, resources, and\ncondition keys for S3 on Outposts. The aws:SourceIp IPv4 values use standard CIDR notation. For more information, see IAM JSON policy elements reference in the IAM User Guide.

Doing this will help\nto make sure that the policies continue to work as you make the transition to IPv6. The following S3 on Outposts example bucket policy shows how to mix IPv4 and IPv6 address\nranges to cover all of your organization's valid IP addresses. The example policy allows access to\nthe example IP addresses 192.0.2.1 and 2001:DB8:1234:5678::1 and denies access to the\naddresses 203.0.113.1 and 2001:DB8:1234:5678:ABCD::1.

S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts\n(OUTPOSTS), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store data durably and\nredundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts. You communicate with\nyour Outpost bucket by using an access point and endpoint connection over a virtual private\ncloud (VPC). You can use the same APIs and features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3\nbuckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging. You can use S3 on Outposts through\nthe AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3 on Outposts. Every object is contained in\na bucket. You must use access points to access any object in an Outpost bucket. When you specify\nthe bucket for object operations, you use the access point Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the\naccess point alias. For more information about access point aliases, see Using a bucket-style alias\nfor your S3 on Outposts bucket access point. The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts access points, which includes the\nAWS Region code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to, the AWS account ID, the Outpost ID,\nand the access point name:\narn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name\nFor more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Resource ARNs for S3 on Outposts. Object ARNs use the following format, which includes the AWS Region that the Outpost is homed\nto, AWS account ID, Outpost ID, bucket name, and object key:\narn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/ op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/amzn-\ns3-demo-bucket1/object/myobject\nWith Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost. When AWS installs an\nOutpost rack, your data stays local to your Outpost to meet data-residency requirements. Your\nobjects never leave your Outpost and are not in an AWS Region. Because the AWS Management\nConsole is hosted in-Region, you can't use the console to upload or manage objects in your\nOutpost. However, you can use the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS\nSDKs to upload and manage your objects through your access points.

Every object is contained in\na bucket. You must use access points to access any object in an Outpost bucket. When you specify\nthe bucket for object operations, you use the access point Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the\naccess point alias. For more information about access point aliases, see Using a bucket-style alias\nfor your S3 on Outposts bucket access point. The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts access points, which includes the\nAWS Region code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to, the AWS account ID, the Outpost ID,\nand the access point name:\nUsing HeadBucket API Version 2006-03-01 81\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\narn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name\nFor more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Resource ARNs for S3 on Outposts. Note\nWith Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost. When AWS\ninstalls an Outpost rack, your data stays local to your Outpost to meet data-residency\nrequirements. Your objects never leave your Outpost and are not in an AWS Region. Because the AWS Management Console is hosted in-Region, you can't use the console\nto upload or manage objects in your Outpost. However, you can use the REST API, AWS\nCommand Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs to upload and manage your objects\nthrough your access points. The following AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS SDK for Java examples show\nyou how to use the HeadBucket API operation to determine if an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket\nexists and whether you have permission to access it. For more information, see HeadBucket in the\nAmazon Simple Storage Service API Reference. Using the AWS CLI\nThe following S3 on Outposts AWS CLI example uses the head-bucket command to determine\nif a bucket exists and you have permissions to access it. To use this command, replace each user\ninput placeholder with your own information.

With presigned URLs, you as the bucket owner can\nshare objects with individuals in your virtual private cloud (VPC) or grant them the ability to upload\nor delete objects. When you create a presigned URL by using the AWS SDKs or the AWS Command Line Interface\n(AWS CLI), you associate the URL with a specific action. You also grant time-limited access to the\npresigned URL by choosing a custom expiration time that can be as low as 1 second and as high\nas 7 days. When you share the presigned URL, the individual in the VPC can perform the action\nembedded in the URL as if they were the original signing user. When the URL reaches its expiration\ntime, the URL expires and no longer works. Limiting presigned URL capabilities\nThe capabilities of a presigned URL are limited by the permissions of the user who created it. In\nessence, presigned URLs are bearer tokens that grant access to those who possess them. As such,\nwe recommend that you protect them appropriately. AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4)\nTo enforce specific behavior when presigned URL requests are authenticated by using AWS\nSignature Version 4 (SigV4), you can use condition keys in bucket policies and access point policies. For example, you can create a bucket policy that uses the s3-outposts:signatureAge condition\nto deny any Amazon S3 on Outposts presigned URL request on objects in the example-outpost-\nUsing presigned URLs API Version 2006-03-01 91\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nbucket bucket if the signature is more than 10 minutes old. To use this example, replace the user\ninput placeholders with your own information. {\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\": [\n{\n\"Sid\": \"Deny a presigned URL request if the signature is more than 10\nminutes old\",\n\"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n\"Principal\": {\"AWS\":\"444455556666\"},\n\"Action\": \"s3-outposts:*\",\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-\neast-1:111122223333:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outpost-bucket/object/\n*\",\n\"Condition\": {\n\"NumericGreaterThan\": {\"s3-outposts:signatureAge\": 600000},\n\"StringEquals\": {\"s3-outposts:authType\": \"REST-QUERY-STRING\"}\n}\n}\n]\n}\nFor a list of condition keys and additional example policies that you can use to enforce specific\nbehavior when presigned URL requests are authenticated by using Signature Version 4, see AWS\nSignature Version 4 (SigV4) authentication-specific policy keys. Network path restriction\nIf you want to restrict the use of presigned URLs and all S3 on Outposts access to particular\nnetwork paths, you can write policies that require a particular network path. To set the restriction\non the IAM principal that makes the call, you can use identity-based AWS Identity and Access\nManagement (IAM) policies (for example, user, group, or role policies). To set the restriction on the\nS3 on Outposts resource, you can use resource-based policies (for example, bucket and access point\npolicies). A network-path restriction on the IAM principal requires the user of those credentials to make\nrequests from the specified network. A restriction on the bucket or access point requires that\nall requests to that resource originate from the specified network. These restrictions also apply\noutside of the presigned URL scenario. Limiting presigned URL capabilities API Version 2006-03-01 92\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nThe IAM global condition that you use depends on the type of endpoint. If you are using the public\nendpoint for S3 on Outposts, use aws:SourceIp. If you are using a VPC endpoint for S3 on\nOutposts, use aws:SourceVpc or aws:SourceVpce. The following IAM policy statement requires the principal to access AWS only from the specified\nnetwork range. With this policy statement, all access must originate from that range. This includes\nthe case of someone who's using a presigned URL for S3 on Outposts. To use this example, replace\nthe user input placeholders with your own information. {\n\"Sid\": \"NetworkRestrictionForIAMPrincipal\",\n\"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n\"Action\": \"*\",\n\"Resource\": \"*\",\n\"Condition\": {\n\"NotIpAddressIfExists\": {\"aws:SourceIp\": \"IP-address-range\"},\n\"BoolIfExists\": {\"aws:ViaAWSService\": \"false\"}\n}\n}\nFor an example bucket policy that uses the aws:SourceIP AWS global condition key to restrict\naccess to an S3 on Outposts bucket to a specific network range, see Setting up IAM with S3 on\nOutposts. Who can create a presigned URL\nAnyone with valid security credentials can create a presigned URL. But for a user in the VPC to\nsuccessfully access an object, the presigned URL must be created by someone who has permission\nto perform the operation that the presigned URL is based upon. You can use the following credentials to create a presigned URL:\n\u2022 IAM instance profile \u2013 Valid up to 6 hours. \u2022 AWS Security Token Service \u2013 Valid up to 36 hours when signed with permanent credentials,\nsuch as the credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user. \u2022 IAM user \u2013 Valid up to 7 days when you're using AWS Signature Version 4. To create a presigned URL that's valid for up to 7 days, first delegate IAM user credentials (the\naccess key and secret key) to the SDK that you're using. Then, generate a presigned URL by using\nAWS Signature Version 4.\nWho can create a presigned URL API Version 2006-03-01 93\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nNote\n\u2022 If you created a presigned URL by using a temporary token, the URL expires when the\ntoken expires, even if you created the URL with a later expiration time. \u2022 Because presigned URLs grant access to your S3 on Outposts buckets to whoever has the\nURL, we recommend that you protect them appropriately. For more information about\nprotecting presigned URLs, see Limiting presigned URL capabilities. When does S3 on Outposts check the expiration date and time of a\npresigned URL? At the time of the HTTP request, S3 on Outposts checks the expiration date and time of a signed\nURL. For example, if a client begins to download a large file immediately before the expiration\ntime, the download continues even if the expiration time passes during the download. However, if\nthe connection drops and the client tries to restart the download after the expiration time passes,\nthe download fails. For more information about using a presigned URL to share or upload objects, see the following\ntopics.

When you create a presigned URL, you must provide your security credentials, and then specify the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 An access point Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket\n\u2022 An object key\n\u2022 An HTTP method (GET for downloading objects)\n\u2022 An expiration date and time\nA presigned URL is valid only for the specified duration. That is, you must start the action that's\nallowed by the URL before the expiration date and time. You can use a presigned URL multiple\ntimes, up to the expiration date and time. If you created a presigned URL by using a temporary\ntoken, then the URL expires when the token expires, even if you created the URL with a later\nexpiration time. Users in the virtual private cloud (VPC) who have access to the presigned URL can access the object. For example, if you have a video in your bucket and both the bucket and the object are private,\nyou can share the video with others by generating a presigned URL. Because presigned URLs\ngrant access to your S3 on Outposts buckets to whoever has the URL, we recommend that you\nprotect these URLs appropriately. For more details about protecting presigned URLs, see Limiting\npresigned URL capabilities. Anyone with valid security credentials can create a presigned URL. However, the presigned URL\nmust be created by someone who has permission to perform the operation that the presigned URL\nis based upon. For more information, see Who can create a presigned URL.

Generating a presigned URL to upload an object to an S3 on Outposts\nbucket\nTo grant time-limited access to objects that are stored locally on an Outpost without updating your\nbucket policy, you can use a presigned URL. With presigned URLs, you as the bucket owner can\nshare objects with individuals in your virtual private cloud (VPC) or grant them the ability to upload\nor delete objects. Uploading an object API Version 2006-03-01 99\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nWhen you create a presigned URL by using the AWS SDKs or the AWS Command Line Interface\n(AWS CLI), you associate the URL with a specific action. You also grant time-limited access to the\npresigned URL by choosing a custom expiration time that can be as low as 1 second and as high\nas 7 days. When you share the presigned URL, the individual in the VPC can perform the action\nembedded in the URL as if they were the original signing user. When the URL reaches its expiration\ntime, the URL expires and no longer works. When you create a presigned URL, you must provide your security credentials, and then specify the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 An access point Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket\n\u2022 An object key\n\u2022 An HTTP method (PUT for uploading objects)\n\u2022 An expiration date and time\nA presigned URL is valid only for the specified duration. That is, you must start the action that's\nallowed by the URL before the expiration date and time. You can use a presigned URL multiple\ntimes, up to the expiration date and time. If you created a presigned URL by using a temporary\ntoken, then the URL expires when the token expires, even if you created the URL with a later\nexpiration time. If the action allowed by a presigned URL consists of multiple steps, such as a multipart upload,\nyou must start all steps before the expiration time. If S3 on Outposts tries to start a step with an\nexpired URL, you receive an error. Users in the virtual private cloud (VPC) who have access to the presigned URL can upload objects. For example, a user in the VPC who has access to the presigned URL can upload an object to your\nbucket. Because presigned URLs grant access to your S3 on Outposts bucket to any user in the VPC\nwho has access to the presigned URL, we recommend that you protect these URLs appropriately. For more details about protecting presigned URLs, see Limiting presigned URL capabilities. Anyone with valid security credentials can create a presigned URL. However, the presigned URL\nmust be created by someone who has permission to perform the operation that the presigned URL\nis based upon. For more information, see Who can create a presigned URL.

By\nusing these frameworks and related open-source projects, you can process data for analytics\npurposes and business intelligence workloads. Amazon EMR also helps you transform and move\nlarge amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and databases, and supports Amazon\nS3 on Outposts. For more information about Amazon EMR, see Amazon EMR on Outposts in the\nAmazon EMR Management Guide. Amazon S3 on Outposts with local Amazon EMR API Version 2006-03-01 104\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nFor Amazon S3 on Outposts, Amazon EMR started to support the Apache Hadoop S3A connector in\nversion 7.0.0. Earlier versions of Amazon EMR don't support local S3 on Outposts, and the EMR File\nSystem (EMRFS) is not supported. Supported applications\nAmazon EMR with Amazon S3 on Outposts supports the following applications:\n\u2022 Hadoop\n\u2022 Spark\n\u2022 Hue\n\u2022 Hive\n\u2022 Sqoop\n\u2022 Pig\n\u2022 Hudi\n\u2022 Flink\nFor more information, see the Amazon EMR Release Guide. Create and configure an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket\nAmazon EMR uses the AWS SDK for Java with Amazon S3 on Outposts to store input data and\noutput data. Your Amazon EMR log files are stored in a Regional Amazon S3 location that you\nselect and aren't stored locally on the Outpost. For more information, see Amazon EMR logs in the\nAmazon EMR Management Guide. To conform with Amazon S3 and DNS requirements, S3 on Outposts buckets have naming\nrestrictions and limitations. For more information, see Creating an S3 on Outposts bucket. With Amazon EMR version 7.0.0 and later, you can use Amazon EMR with S3 on Outposts and the\nS3A file system. Prerequisites\nS3 on Outposts permissions \u2013 When you create your Amazon EMR instance profile, your role must\ncontain the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) namespace for S3 on Outposts. S3 on\nOutposts has its own namespace, s3-outposts*. For an example policy that uses this namespace,\nsee Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts. Creating an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket API Version 2006-03-01 105\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nS3A connector \u2013 To configure your EMR cluster to access data from an Amazon S3 on Outposts\nbucket, you must use the Apache Hadoop S3A connector. To use the connector, ensure that all of\nyour S3 URIs use the s3a scheme. If they don't, you can configure the file system implementation\nthat you use for your EMR cluster so that your S3 URIs work with the S3A connector. To configure the file system implementation to work with the S3A connector, you use the\nfs.file_scheme.impl and fs.AbstractFileSystem.file_scheme.impl configuration\nproperties for your EMR cluster, where file_scheme corresponds to the type of S3 URIs that\nyou have. To use the following example, replace the user input placeholders with your own\ninformation. For example, to change the file system implementation for S3 URIs that use the s3\nscheme, specify the following cluster configuration properties:\n[\n{\n\"Classification\": \"core-site\",\n\"Properties\": {\n\"fs.s3.impl\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem\",\n\"fs.AbstractFileSystem.s3.impl\": \"org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3A\"\n}\n}\n]\nTo use S3A, set the fs.file_scheme.impl configuration property\nto org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem, and set the\nfs.AbstractFileSystem.file_scheme.impl property to\norg.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3A. For example, if you are accessing the path s3a://bucket/..., set the fs.s3a.impl\nproperty to org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem, and set the\nfs.AbstractFileSystem.s3a.impl property to org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3A.

Only S3A has the\nfeatures required to interact with S3 on Outposts buckets. For S3A connector setup information,\nsee Prerequisites. \u2022 Amazon S3 on Outposts supports only server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys\n(SSE-S3) with Amazon EMR. For more information, see the section called \u201cData encryption\u201d. \u2022 Amazon S3 on Outposts doesn't support writes with the S3A FileOutputCommitter. Writes\nwith the S3A FileOutputCommitter on S3 on Outposts buckets result in the following error:\nInvalidStorageClass: The storage class you specified is not valid. \u2022 Amazon S3 on Outposts isn't supported with Amazon EMR Serverless or Amazon EMR on EKS. \u2022 Amazon EMR logs are stored in a Regional Amazon S3 location that you select, and are not\nstored locally in the S3 on Outposts bucket. Authorization and authentication caching\nS3 on Outposts securely caches authentication and authorization data locally on Outposts racks. The cache removes round trips to the parent AWS Region for every request. This eliminates the\nvariability that is introduced by network round trips. With the authentication and authorization\ncache in S3 on Outposts, you get consistent latencies that are independent from the latency of the\nconnection between the Outposts and the AWS Region. When you make an S3 on Outposts API request, the authentication and authorization data is\nsecurely cached. The cached data is then used to authenticate subsequent S3 object API requests. S3 on Outposts only caches authentication and authorization data when the request is signed\nusing Signature Version 4A (SigV4A). The cache is stored locally on the Outposts within the S3\non Outposts service. It asynchronously refreshes when you make an S3 API request. The cache is\nencrypted, and no plaintext cryptographic keys are stored on Outposts. The cache is valid for up to 10 minutes when the Outpost is connected to the AWS Region. It is\nrefreshed asynchronously when you make an S3 on Outposts API request, to ensure that the latest\npolicies are used. If the Outpost is disconnected from the AWS Region, the cache will be valid for\nup to 12 hours. Authorization and authentication caching API Version 2006-03-01 111\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nConfiguring the authorization and authentication cache\nS3 on Outposts automatically caches authentication and authorization data for requests signed\nwith the SigV4A algorithm. For more information, see Signing AWS API requests in the AWS\nIdentity and Access Management User Guide. The SigV4A algorithm is available in the latest versions\nof the AWS SDKs. You can obtain it through a dependency on the AWS Common Runtime (CRT)\nlibraries. You need to use the latest version of the AWS SDK and install the latest version of the CRT. For\nexample, you can run pip install awscrt to obtain the latest version of the CRT with Boto3. S3 on Outposts does not cache authentication and authorization data for requests signed with the\nSigV4 algorithm. Validating SigV4A signing\nYou can use AWS CloudTrail to validate that requests were signed with SigV4A. For more\ninformation on setting up CloudTrail for S3 on Outposts, see Monitoring S3 on Outposts with AWS\nCloudTrail logs. After you have configured CloudTrail, you can verify how a request was signed in the\nSignatureVersion field of the CloudTrail logs. Requests that were signed with SigV4A will have\na SignatureVersion set to AWS4-ECDSA-P256-SHA256. Requests that were signed with SigV4\nwill have SignatureVersion set to AWS4-HMAC-SHA256.

As an AWS customer, you benefit from data centers\nand network architectures that are built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive\norganizations. Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The shared responsibility model describes\nthis as security of the cloud and security in the cloud:\n\u2022 Security of the cloud \u2013 AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS\nservices in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third-\nparty auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the AWS\nCompliance Programs. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to Amazon S3 on\nOutposts, see AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program. \u2022 Security in the cloud \u2013 Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You\nare also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company's\nrequirements, and applicable laws and regulations. This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when\nusing S3 on Outposts. The following topics show you how to configure S3 on Outposts to meet\nyour security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use other AWS services that help\nyou to monitor and secure your S3 on Outposts resources.

IAM is an AWS service\nthat you can use with no additional charge. By default, users don't have permissions for S3 on\nOutposts resources and operations. To grant access permissions for S3 on Outposts resources and\nAPI operations, you can use IAM to create users, groups, or roles and attach permissions. To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:\n\u2022 Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:\nCreate a permission set. Follow the instructions in Create a permission set in the AWS IAM\nIdentity Center User Guide. \u2022 Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:\nCreate a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in Creating a role for a third-party\nidentity provider (federation) in the IAM User Guide. \u2022 IAM users:\n\u2022 Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in Creating a role for an IAM\nuser in the IAM User Guide. \u2022 (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the\ninstructions in Adding permissions to a user (console) in the IAM User Guide. In addition to IAM identity-based policies, S3 on Outposts supports both bucket and access point\npolicies. Bucket policies and access point policies are resource-based policies that are attached to\nthe S3 on Outposts resource. \u2022 A bucket policy is attached to the bucket and allows or denies requests to the bucket and the\nobjects in it based on the elements in the policy. \u2022 In contrast, an access point policy is attached to the access point and allows or denies requests to\nthe access point. The access point policy works with the bucket policy that is attached to the underlying S3 on\nOutposts bucket. For an application or user to access objects in an S3 on Outposts bucket through\nan S3 on Outposts access point, both the access point policy and the bucket policy must permit the\nrequest. Restrictions that you include in an access point policy apply only to requests made through that\naccess point. For example, if an access point is attached to a bucket, you can't use the access point\nSetting up IAM API Version 2006-03-01 114\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\npolicy to allow or deny requests that are made directly to the bucket. However, restrictions that\nyou apply to a bucket policy can allow or deny requests made directly to the bucket or through the\naccess point. In an IAM policy or a resource-based policy, you define which S3 on Outposts actions are allowed\nor denied. S3 on Outposts actions correspond to specific S3 on Outposts API operations. S3 on\nOutposts actions use the s3-outposts: namespace prefix. Requests made to the S3 on Outposts\ncontrol API in an AWS Region and requests made to the object API endpoints on the Outpost are\nauthenticated by using IAM and authorized against the s3-outposts: namespace prefix. To work\nwith S3 on Outposts, configure your IAM users and authorize them against the s3-outposts: IAM\nnamespace. For more information, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3 on Outposts in the\nService Authorization Reference. Note\n\u2022 Access control lists (ACLs) are not supported by S3 on Outposts. \u2022 S3 on Outposts defaults to the bucket owner as object owner to help ensure that the\nowner of a bucket can't be prevented from accessing or deleting objects. \u2022 S3 on Outposts always has S3 Block Public Access enabled to help ensure that objects\ncan never have public access.

For S3 on Outposts policies, you can use one of the following\nprincipals:\n\u2022 An AWS account\n\u2022 An IAM user\n\u2022 An IAM role\n\u2022 All principals, by specifying a wildcard character (*) in a policy that uses a Condition element to\nlimit access to a specific IP range\nImportant\nYou can't write a policy for an S3 on Outposts bucket that uses a wildcard character (*) in\nthe Principal element unless the policy also includes a Condition that limits access to a\nspecific IP address range. This restriction helps ensure that there is no public access to your\nS3 on Outposts bucket. For an example, see Example policies for S3 on Outposts. For more information about the Principal element, see AWS JSON policy elements: Principal in\nthe IAM User Guide. Resource ARNs for S3 on Outposts\nAmazon Resource Names (ARNs) for S3 on Outposts contain the Outpost ID in addition to the\nAWS Region that the Outpost is homed to, the AWS account ID, and the resource name. To access\nand perform actions on your Outposts buckets and objects, you must use one of the ARN formats\nshown in the following table.

AWS PrivateLink for S3 on Outposts\nS3 on Outposts supports AWS PrivateLink, which provides direct management access to your S3\non Outposts storage through a private endpoint within your virtual private network. This allows\nyou to simplify your internal network architecture and perform management operations on your\nOutposts object storage by using private IP addresses in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Using\nAWS PrivateLink eliminates the need to use public IP addresses or proxy servers. With AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can provision interface VPC endpoints in\nyour virtual private cloud (VPC) to access your S3 on Outposts bucket management and endpoint\nmanagement APIs. Interface VPC endpoints are directly accessible from applications deployed\nin your VPC or on premises over your virtual private network (VPN) or AWS Direct Connect. You can access the bucket and endpoint management APIs through AWS PrivateLink. AWS\nPrivateLink doesn't support data transfer API operations, such as GET, PUT, and similar APIs. These\noperations are already transferred privately through the S3 on Outposts endpoint and access point\nconfiguration. For more information, see Networking for S3 on Outposts. Interface endpoints are represented by one or more elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that are\nassigned private IP addresses from subnets in your VPC. Requests made to interface endpoints for\nS3 on Outposts are automatically routed to S3 on Outposts bucket and endpoint management\nAPIs on the AWS network. You can also access interface endpoints in your VPC from on-premises\napplications through AWS Direct Connect or AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN). For more\ninformation about how to connect your VPC with your on-premises network, see the AWS Direct\nConnect User Guide and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.

When you create an interface\nendpoint, AWS PrivateLink generates two types of endpoint-specific S3 on Outposts names:\nRegional and zonal. \u2022 Regional DNS names \u2013 include a unique VPC endpoint ID, a service identifier, the AWS Region,\nand vpce.amazonaws.com, for example, vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3-outposts.us-\neast-1.vpce.amazonaws.com. \u2022 Zonal DNS names \u2013 include a unique VPC endpoint ID, the Availability Zone, a service identifier,\nthe AWS Region, and vpce.amazonaws.com, for example, vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f-us-\neast-1a.s3-outposts.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com. You might use this option if\nyour architecture isolates Availability Zones. For example, you could use zonal DNS names for\nfault containment or to reduce Regional data transfer costs. Important\nS3 on Outposts interface endpoints are resolved from the public DNS domain. S3 on\nOutposts does not support private DNS.

Creating a VPC endpoint for S3 on Outposts\nTo create a VPC interface endpoint for S3 on Outposts, see Create a VPC endpoint in the AWS\nPrivateLink Guide. Creating bucket policies and VPC endpoint policies for S3 on Outposts\nYou can attach an endpoint policy to your VPC endpoint that controls access to S3 on Outposts. You can also use the aws:sourceVpce condition in S3 on Outposts bucket policies to restrict\naccess to specific buckets from a specific VPC endpoint. With VPC endpoint policies, you can\ncontrol access to S3 on Outposts bucket management APIs and endpoint management APIs. With\nbucket policies, you can control access to the S3 on Outposts bucket management APIs. However,\nyou can't manage access to object actions for S3 on Outposts using aws:sourceVpce. Access policies for S3 on Outposts specify the following information:\n\u2022 The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) principal for which actions are allowed or\ndenied. \u2022 The S3 control actions that are allowed or denied. \u2022 The S3 on Outposts resources on which actions are allowed or denied. The following examples show policies that restrict access to a bucket or to an endpoint. For\nmore information about VPC connectivity, see Network-to-VPC connectivity options in the AWS\nwhitepaper Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options. Important\n\u2022 When you apply the example policies for VPC endpoints described in this section, you\nmight block your access to the bucket without intending to do so.

AWS\nmanaged policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can\nstart assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your\nspecific use cases because they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you\nreduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use\ncases. You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the\npermissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users,\ngroups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed\npolicy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing\nservices. For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide. AWS managed policy: AWSS3OnOutpostsServiceRolePolicy\nHelps manage network resources for you as part of the service-linked role\nAWSServiceRoleForS3OnOutposts. To view the permissions for this policy, see AWSS3OnOutpostsServiceRolePolicy.

Using service-linked roles for Amazon S3 on Outposts\nAmazon S3 on Outposts uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A\nservice-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to S3 on Outposts. Service-\nlinked roles are predefined by S3 on Outposts and include all the permissions that the service\nrequires to call other AWS services on your behalf. A service-linked role makes setting up S3 on Outposts easier because you don\u2019t have to manually\nadd the necessary permissions. S3 on Outposts defines the permissions of its service-linked roles,\nand unless defined otherwise, only S3 on Outposts can assume its roles. The defined permissions\ninclude the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached\nto any other IAM entity. You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting their related resources. This protects\nyour S3 on Outposts resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the\nresources. Policy updates API Version 2006-03-01 133\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nFor information about other services that support service-linked roles, see AWS Services That Work\nwith IAM and look for the services that have Yes in the Service-linked roles column.

When you create an S3 on Outposts\nendpoint in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, S3 on Outposts creates\nthe service-linked role for you. If you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process\nto recreate the role in your account. When you create an S3 on Outposts endpoint, S3 on Outposts\ncreates the service-linked role for you again. You can also use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the S3 on Outposts\nuse case. In the AWS CLI or the AWS API, create a service-linked role with the s3-\noutposts.amazonaws.com service name. For more information, see Creating a service-linked\nrole in the IAM User Guide. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to\ncreate the role again. Editing a service-linked role for S3 on Outposts\nS3 on Outposts does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForS3OnOutposts service-\nlinked role. This includes the name of the role because various entities might reference it. However,\nyou can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see Editing a service-\nlinked role in the IAM User Guide. Deleting a service-linked role for S3 on Outposts\nIf you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend\nthat you delete that role. That way you don\u2019t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored\nor maintained. However, you must clean up the resources for your service-linked role before you\ncan manually delete it. Note\nIf the S3 on Outposts service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then\nthe deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again. To delete S3 on Outposts resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForS3OnOutposts role\n1. Delete the S3 on Outposts endpoints in your AWS account across all AWS Regions. Creating a service-linked role for S3 on Outposts API Version 2006-03-01 137\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n2. Delete the service-linked role using IAM. Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the\nAWSServiceRoleForS3OnOutposts service-linked role. For more information, see Deleting\na service-linked role in the IAM User Guide. Supported Regions for S3 on Outposts service-linked roles\nS3 on Outposts supports using service-linked roles in all of the AWS Regions where the service is\navailable.

Supported Regions for S3 on Outposts service-linked roles API Version 2006-03-01 138\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nManaging S3 on Outposts storage\nWith Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily\nstore and retrieve objects on premises for applications that require local data access, local\ndata processing, and data residency. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts\n(OUTPOSTS), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store data durably and\nredundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts. You communicate with\nyour Outpost bucket by using an access point and endpoint connection over a virtual private\ncloud (VPC). You can use the same APIs and features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3\nbuckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging. You can use S3 on Outposts through\nthe AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. For more information, see What is Amazon S3 on Outposts? For more information about managing and sharing your Amazon S3 on Outposts storage capacity,\nsee the following topics.

You\ncan use S3 Versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your\nOutposts buckets. S3 Versioning helps you recover from unintended user actions and application\nfailures. Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets have three versioning states:\n\u2022 Unversioned \u2013 If you\u2019ve never enabled or suspended S3 Versioning on your bucket, it is\nunversioned and returns no S3 Versioning status. For more information about S3 Versioning, see\nManaging S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket. Managing S3 Versioning API Version 2006-03-01 139\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n\u2022 Enabled \u2013 Enables S3 Versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket\nreceive a unique version ID. Objects that already existed in the bucket at the time that you\nenable versioning have a version ID of null. If you modify these (or any other) objects with other\noperations, such as PutObject, the new objects get a unique version ID. \u2022 Suspended \u2013 Suspends S3 Versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the\nbucket after versioning is suspended receive the version ID null. For more information, see\nAdding objects to versioning-suspended buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide. After you enable S3 Versioning for an S3 on Outposts bucket, it can never return to an unversioned\nstate. However, you can suspend versioning. For more information about S3 Versioning, see\nManaging S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket. For each object in your bucket, you have a current version and zero or more noncurrent versions. To reduce storage costs, you can configure your bucket S3 Lifecycle rules to expire noncurrent\nversions after a specified time period. For more information, see Creating and managing a lifecycle\nconfiguration for your Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. The following examples show you how to enable or suspend versioning for an existing S3 on\nOutposts bucket by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface\n(AWS CLI). To create a bucket with S3 Versioning enabled, see Creating an S3 on Outposts bucket. Note\nThe AWS account that creates the bucket owns it and is the only one that can commit\nactions to it. Buckets have configuration properties, such as Outpost, tag, default\nencryption, and access point settings. The access point settings include the virtual private\ncloud (VPC), the access point policy for accessing the objects in the bucket, and other\nmetadata. For more information, see S3 on Outposts specifications. Using the S3 console\nTo edit the S3 Versioning settings for your bucket\n1.

You\ncan use S3 Replication on Outposts to maintain multiple replicas of your data in the same or\ndifferent Outposts, or across different accounts, to help meet data-residency needs. S3 Replication\non Outposts helps power your compliant storage needs and data sharing across accounts. If you\nneed to ensure that your replicas are identical to the source data, you can use S3 Replication on\nOutposts to make replicas of your objects that retain all metadata, such as the original object\ncreation time, tags, and version IDs. S3 Replication on Outposts also provides detailed metrics and notifications to monitor the\nstatus of object replication between buckets.

For more information about S3 on Outposts replication configuration and replication rules, see\nReplicationConfiguration in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference. Requirements for S3 Replication on Outposts\nReplication requires the following:\n\u2022 The destination Outpost CIDR range must be associated in your source Outpost subnet table. For\nmore information, see Prerequisites for creating replication rules. \u2022 Both the source and destination buckets must have S3 Versioning enabled. For more information\nabout versioning, see Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket. \u2022 Amazon S3 on Outposts must have permission to replicate objects from the source bucket to the\ndestination bucket on your behalf. That means you must create a service role to delegate GET\nand PUT permissions to S3 on Outposts. 1. Before creating the service role, you must have GET permission on the source bucket and PUT\npermission on the destination bucket. 2. To create the service role to delegate permissions to S3 on Outposts, you must first configure\npermissions to allow an IAM entity (a user or role) to perform the iam:CreateRole and\niam:PassRole actions. Then, you allow the IAM entity to create a service role. To make S3\non Outposts assume the service role on your behalf and delegate GET and PUT permissions to\nS3 on Outposts, you must assign the necessary trust and permissions policies to the role. For\nmore information about these permissions for S3 on Outposts, see Creating an IAM role. For\nmore information about creating a service role, see Creating a service role. Requirements for S3 Replication on Outposts API Version 2006-03-01 151\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nWhat is replicated? By default, S3 on Outposts replicates the following:\n\u2022 Objects created after you add a replication configuration. \u2022 Object metadata from the source objects to the replicas. For information about how to replicate\nmetadata from the replicas to the source objects, see Replication status if Amazon S3 replica\nmodification sync on Outposts is enabled. \u2022 Object tags, if there are any. How delete operations affect replication\nIf you delete an object from the source bucket, the following actions occur by default:\n\u2022 If you make a DELETE request without specifying an object version ID, S3 on Outposts adds a\ndelete marker. S3 on Outposts deals with the delete marker as follows:\n\u2022 S3 on Outposts does not replicate the delete marker by default. \u2022 However, you can add delete marker replication to non-tag-based rules. For more information\nabout how to enable delete marker replication in your replication configuration, see Using the\nS3 console. \u2022 If you specify an object version ID to delete in a DELETE request, S3 on Outposts permanently\ndeletes that object version in the source bucket. However, it doesn't replicate the deletion in\nthe destination buckets. In other words, it doesn't delete the same object version from the\ndestination buckets. This behavior protects data from malicious deletions. What isn't replicated? By default, S3 on Outposts doesn't replicate the following:\n\u2022 Objects in the source bucket that are replicas that were created by another replication rule. For\nexample, suppose you configure replication where bucket A is the source and bucket B is the\ndestination. Now suppose that you add another replication configuration where bucket B is the\nsource and bucket C is the destination. In this case, objects in bucket B that are replicas of objects\nin bucket A are not replicated to bucket C.\nWhat is replicated? API Version 2006-03-01 152\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n\u2022 Objects in the source bucket that have already been replicated to a different destination. For\nexample, if you change the destination bucket in an existing replication configuration, S3 on\nOutposts won't replicate the objects again. \u2022 Objects that are created with server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys\n(SSE-C). \u2022 Updates to bucket-level subresources. For example, if you change the lifecycle configuration or add a notification configuration to your\nsource bucket, these changes are not applied to the destination bucket. This feature makes it\npossible to have different configurations on the source and destination buckets. \u2022 Actions performed by lifecycle configuration. For example, if you enable a lifecycle configuration only on your source bucket and configure\nexpiration actions, S3 on Outposts creates delete markers for expired objects in the source\nbucket but doesn't replicate those markers to the destination buckets. If you want the same\nlifecycle configuration applied to both the source and destination buckets, enable the same\nlifecycle configuration on both. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see Creating\nand managing a lifecycle configuration for your Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. What isn't supported by S3 Replication on Outposts? The following S3 Replication features are currently not supported by S3 on Outposts:\n\u2022 S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC). S3 RTC is not supported because the object traffic in S3\nReplication on Outposts travels over your on-premises network (the local gateway). For more\ninformation about local gateways, see Working with the local gateway in the AWS Outposts User\nGuide. \u2022 S3 Replication for Batch Operations. Setting up replication\nNote\nObjects that existed in your bucket before you set up a replication rule aren't replicated\nautomatically. In other words, Amazon S3 on Outposts doesn't replicate objects\nretroactively. To replicate objects that were created before your replication configuration,\nWhat isn't supported by S3 Replication on Outposts? API Version 2006-03-01 153\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nyou can use the CopyObject API operation to copy them to the same bucket. After\nthe objects are copied, they appear as \"new\" objects in the bucket and the replication\nconfiguration will apply to them. For more information about copying an object, see\nCopying an object in an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket using the AWS SDK for Java and\nCopyObject in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference. To enable S3 Replication on Outposts, add a replication rule to your source Outposts bucket. The\nreplication rule tells S3 on Outposts to replicate objects as specified. In the replication rule, you\nmust provide the following:\n\u2022 The source Outposts bucket access point \u2013 The access point Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or\naccess point alias of the bucket from which you want S3 on Outposts to replicate the objects. For\nmore information about using access point aliases, see Using a bucket-style alias for your S3 on\nOutposts bucket access point. \u2022 The objects that you want to replicate \u2013 You can replicate all of the objects in the source\nOutposts bucket or a subset. You identify a subset by providing a key name prefix, one or more\nobject tags, or both in the configuration. For example, if you configure a replication rule to replicate only objects with the key name prefix\nTax/, S3 on Outposts replicates objects with keys such as Tax/doc1 or Tax/doc2. But it doesn't\nreplicate objects with the key Legal/doc3. If you specify both a prefix and one or more tags, S3\non Outposts replicates only objects that have the specific key prefix and tags. \u2022 The destination Outposts bucket \u2013 The ARN or access point alias of the bucket to which you\nwant S3 on Outposts to replicate the objects. You can configure the replication rule by using the REST API, AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line\nInterface (AWS CLI), or Amazon S3 console. S3 on Outposts also provides API operations to support setting up replication rules.

For information about the IAM role, see Creating an IAM role. Creating replication rules on Outposts\nS3 Replication on Outposts is the automatic, asynchronous replication of objects across buckets in\nthe same or different AWS Outposts. Replication copies newly created objects and object updates\nSetting up replication API Version 2006-03-01 162\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nfrom a source Outposts bucket to a destination Outposts bucket or buckets. For more information,\nsee Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts. Note\nObjects that existed in the source Outposts bucket before you set up replication rules\naren't replicated. In other words, S3 on Outposts doesn't replicate objects retroactively. To\nreplicate objects that were created before your replication configuration, you can use the\nCopyObject API operation to copy them to the same bucket. After the objects are copied,\nthey appear as \"new\" objects in the bucket and the replication configuration will apply to\nthem. For more information about copying an object, see Copying an object in an Amazon\nS3 on Outposts bucket using the AWS SDK for Java and CopyObject in the Amazon Simple\nStorage Service API Reference. When you configure replication, you add replication rules to the source Outposts bucket. Replication rules define which source Outposts bucket objects to replicate and the destination\nOutposts bucket or buckets where the replicated objects will be stored. You can create a rule to\nreplicate all the objects in a bucket or a subset of objects with a specific key name prefix, one or\nmore object tags, or both. A destination Outposts bucket can be in the same Outpost as the source\nOutposts bucket, or it can be in a different Outpost. For S3 on Outposts replication rules, you must provide both the source Outposts bucket's access\npoint Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and the destination Outposts bucket's access point ARN\ninstead of the source and destination Outposts bucket names. If you specify an object version ID to delete, S3 on Outposts deletes that object version in the\nsource Outposts bucket. But it doesn't replicate the deletion to the destination Outposts bucket. In\nother words, it doesn't delete the same object version from the destination Outposts bucket. This\nbehavior protects data from malicious deletions. When you add a replication rule to an Outposts bucket, the rule is enabled by default, so the rule\nstarts working as soon as you save it. In this example, you set up replication for source and destination Outposts buckets that are on\ndifferent Outposts and are owned by the same AWS account. Examples are provided for using the\nAmazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and the AWS SDK for Java and\nAWS SDK for .NET. For information about cross-account S3 Replication on Outposts permissions,\nSetting up replication API Version 2006-03-01 163\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nsee Granting permissions when the source and destination Outposts buckets are owned by\ndifferent AWS accounts.

With replication metrics, you can monitor in 5-minute intervals the progress of\nreplication by tracking bytes pending replication, replication latency replication, and operations\npending. To assist in troubleshooting any configuration issues, you can also set up Amazon\nEventBridge to receive notifications about replication failures. When replication metrics are enabled, S3 Replication on Outposts publishes the following metrics\nto Amazon CloudWatch:\nManaging your replication API Version 2006-03-01 172\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n\u2022 Bytes Pending Replication \u2013 The total number of bytes of objects that are pending replication\nfor a given replication rule. \u2022 Replication Latency \u2013 The maximum number of seconds by which the replication destination\nbucket is behind the source bucket for a given replication rule. \u2022 Operations Pending Replication \u2013 The number of operations that are pending replication for a\ngiven replication rule. Operations include objects, delete markers, and tags. Note\nS3 Replication on Outposts metrics are billed at the same rate as CloudWatch custom\nmetrics. For more information, see CloudWatch pricing. Getting replication status information\nThe replication status can help you determine the current state of an object that's being replicated\nby Amazon S3 on Outposts. The replication status of a source object will return either PENDING,\nCOMPLETED, or FAILED. The replication status of a replica will return REPLICA. Replication status overview\nIn a replication scenario, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and a\ndestination bucket to which S3 on Outposts replicates objects. When you request an object (using\nGetObject) or object metadata (using HeadObject) from these buckets, S3 on Outposts returns\nthe x-amz-replication-status header in the response as follows:\n\u2022 When you request an object from the source bucket, S3 on Outposts returns the x-amz-\nreplication-status header if the object in your request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that you specify the object prefix TaxDocs in your replication\nconfiguration to tell S3 on Outposts to replicate only objects with the key name prefix\nTaxDocs. Any objects that you upload that have this key name prefix\u2014for example, TaxDocs/\ndocument1.pdf\u2014will be replicated. For object requests with this key name prefix, S3 on\nOutposts returns the x-amz-replication-status header with one of the following values for\nthe object's replication status: PENDING, COMPLETED, or FAILED. Managing your replication API Version 2006-03-01 173\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nNote\nIf object replication fails after you upload an object, you can't retry replication. You must\nupload the object again. Objects transition to a FAILED state for issues such as missing\nreplication role permissions or missing bucket permissions. For temporary failures, such\nas if a bucket or your Outpost is unavailable, the replication status doesn't transition\nto FAILED, but remains PENDING. After the resource is back online, S3 on Outposts\nresumes replicating those objects. \u2022 When you request an object from a destination bucket, if the object in your request is a replica\nthat S3 on Outposts created, S3 on Outposts returns the x-amz-replication-status header\nwith the value REPLICA. Note\nBefore deleting an object from a source bucket that has replication enabled, check the\nobject's replication status to ensure that the object has been replicated. Replication status if Amazon S3 replica modification sync on Outposts is enabled\nWhen your replication rules enable S3 on Outposts replica modification sync, replicas can report\nstatuses other than REPLICA. If metadata changes are in the process of replicating, the x-amz-\nreplication-status header for the replica returns PENDING. If replica modification sync fails to\nreplicate metadata, the header for the replica returns FAILED.",

Troubleshooting replication\nIf object replicas don't appear in the destination Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket after you\nconfigure replication, use these troubleshooting tips to identify and fix issues. \u2022 The time it takes S3 on Outposts to replicate an object depends on several factors, including the\ndistance between the source and destination Outposts, and the size of the object. You can check the source object's replication status. If the object's replication status is PENDING,\nS3 on Outposts hasn't completed the replication. If the object's replication status is FAILED,\ncheck the replication configuration that you set on the source bucket.

Both the source and destination\nbuckets must have versioning enabled. \u2022 If the destination bucket is owned by another AWS account, verify that the bucket owner has a\nbucket policy on the destination bucket that allows the source bucket owner to replicate objects. For an example, see Granting permissions when the source and destination Outposts buckets are\nowned by different AWS accounts. \u2022 If an object replica doesn't appear in the destination bucket, the following issues might prevent\nreplication:\n\u2022 S3 on Outposts doesn't replicate an object in a source bucket that is a replica created by\nanother replication configuration. For example, if you set a replication configuration from\nbucket A to bucket B to bucket C, S3 on Outposts doesn't replicate object replicas in bucket B\nto bucket C.\nIf you want to replicate objects in bucket A to bucket B and bucket C, set multiple bucket\ndestinations in different replication rules for your source bucket replication configuration. For example, create two replication rules on source bucket A, with one rule to replicate to\ndestination bucket B and the other rule to replicate to destination bucket C.\n\u2022 A source bucket owner can grant other AWS accounts permission to upload objects. By default,\nthe source bucket owner doesn't have permissions for the objects created by other accounts. The replication configuration replicates only the objects for which the source bucket owner has\naccess permissions. To avoid replication issues, the source bucket owner can grant other AWS\naccounts permissions to create objects conditionally, requiring explicit access permissions on\nthose objects. \u2022 Suppose that in the replication configuration, you add a rule to replicate a subset of objects that\nhave a specific tag. In this case, you must assign the specific tag key and value at the time that\nthe object is created in order for S3 on Outposts to replicate the object. If you first create an\nobject and then add the tag to that existing object, S3 on Outposts doesn't replicate the object. \u2022 Replication fails if the bucket policy denies access to the replication role for any of the following\nactions:\nManaging your replication API Version 2006-03-01 175\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nSource bucket:\n\"s3-outposts:GetObjectVersionForReplication\",\n\"s3-outposts:GetObjectVersionTagging\"\nDestination buckets:\n\"s3-outposts:ReplicateObject\",\n\"s3-outposts:ReplicateDelete\",\n\"s3-outposts:ReplicateTags\"\n\u2022 Amazon EventBridge can notify you when objects don't replicate to their destination Outposts.

You can use AWS CloudTrail to\nget information about S3 on Outposts bucket-level and object-level requests to audit and log your\nS3 on Outposts event activity. To enable CloudTrail data events for all your Outposts buckets or for a list of specific Outposts\nbuckets, you must create a trail manually in CloudTrail. For more information about CloudTrail log\nfile entries, see S3 on Outposts log file entries. For a complete list of CloudTrail data events for S3 on Outposts, see Amazon S3 data events in\nCloudTrail in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Note\n\u2022 It's a best practice to create a lifecycle policy for your AWS CloudTrail data event\nOutposts bucket. Configure the lifecycle policy to periodically remove log files after\nthe period of time that you need to audit them. Doing so reduces the amount of data\nthat Amazon Athena analyzes for each query. For more information, see Creating and\nmanaging a lifecycle configuration for your Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. \u2022 For examples of how to query CloudTrail logs, see the AWS Big Data Blog post Analyze\nSecurity, Compliance, and Operational Activity Using AWS CloudTrail and Amazon\nAthena.

CloudTrail supports logging S3 on Outposts object-\nlevel API operations such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject. These events are called\ndata events. By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data events. However, you can configure trails to log data\nevents for S3 on Outposts buckets that you specify or to log data events for all the S3 on Outposts\nbuckets in your AWS account.

S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts\n(OUTPOSTS), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store data durably and\nredundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts. You communicate with\nyour Outpost bucket by using an access point and endpoint connection over a virtual private\ncloud (VPC). You can use the same APIs and features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3\nbuckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging. You can use S3 on Outposts through\nthe AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. For more information, see What is Amazon S3 on Outposts?

The\nnext section describes how to make requests over IPv6 by using dual-stack endpoints. The following are important considerations before trying to access an S3 on Outposts bucket over\nIPv6:\n\u2022 The client and the network accessing the bucket must be enabled to use IPv6. \u2022 Both virtual hosted-style and path style requests are supported for IPv6 access. For more\ninformation, see Using S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints. \u2022 If you use source IP address filtering in your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or\nS3 on Outposts bucket policies, you must update the policies to include IPv6 address ranges. Note\nThis requirement only applies to S3 on Outposts bucket operations and control plane\nresources across IPv6 networks. Amazon S3 on Outposts object actions aren\u2019t supported\nacross IPv6 networks. \u2022 When using IPv6, server access log files output IP addresses in an IPv6 format. You must update\nexisting tools, scripts, and software that you use to parse S3 on Outposts log files, so that they\ncan parse the IPv6 formatted remote IP addresses. The updated tools, scripts, and software will\nthen correctly parse the IPv6 formatted remote IP addresses. Getting started with IPv6 API Version 2006-03-01 200\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nUsing dual-stack endpoints to make requests over an IPv6 network\nTo make requests with S3 on Outposts API calls over IPv6, you can use dual-stack endpoints\nvia AWS CLI or AWS SDK. The Amazon S3 control API operations and S3 on Outposts API\noperations work the same way whether you\u2019re accessing S3 on Outposts over an IPv6 protocol\nor IPv4 protocol. However, be aware that S3 on Outposts object actions (such as PutObject or\nGetObject) aren\u2019t supported over IPv6 networks. When using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS SDKs, you can use a parameter\nor flag to change to a dual-stack endpoint. You can also specify the dual-stack endpoint directly as\nan override of the S3 on Outposts endpoint in the configuration file. You can use a dual-stack endpoint to access an S3 on Outposts bucket over IPv6 from any of the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 The AWS CLI, see Using dual-stack endpoints from the AWS CLI. \u2022 The AWS SDKs, see Using S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints from the AWS SDKs. Using IPv6 addresses in IAM policies\nBefore trying to access an S3 on Outposts bucket using an IPv6 protocol, make sure that IAM users\nor S3 on Outposts bucket policies used for IP address filtering are updated to include IPv6 address\nranges. If IP address filtering policies aren\u2019t updated to handle IPv6 addresses, you can lose access\nto an S3 on Outposts bucket while trying to use the IPv6 protocol. IAM policies that filter IP addresses use IP address condition operators. The following S3 on\nOutposts bucket policy identifies the 54.240.143. * IP range of allowed IPv4 addresses by using IP\naddress condition operators. Any IP addresses outside of this range will be denied access to the S3\non Outposts bucket (DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET). Since all IPv6 addresses are outside of the allowed\nrange, this policy prevents IPv6 addresses from being able to access DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET. {\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\": [\n{\n\"Sid\": \"IPAllow\",\n\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\"Principal\": \"*\",\nMaking requests using dual-stack endpoints API Version 2006-03-01 201\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n\"Action\": \"s3outposts:*\",\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:111122223333:outpost/OUTPOSTS-ID/\nbucket/DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*\",\n\"Condition\": {\n\"IpAddress\": {\"aws:SourceIp\": \"54.240.143.0/24\"}\n}\n}\n]\n}\nYou can modify the S3 on Outposts bucket policy's Condition element to allow both IPv4\n(54.240.143.0/24) and IPv6 (2001:DB8:1234:5678::/64) address ranges as shown in the\nfollowing example. You can use the same type of Condition block shown in the example to\nupdate both your IAM user and bucket policies. \"Condition\": {\n\"IpAddress\": {\n\"aws:SourceIp\": [\n\"54.240.143.0/24\",\n\"2001:DB8:1234:5678::/64\"\n]\n}\n}\nBefore using IPv6 you must update all relevant IAM user and bucket policies that use IP address\nfiltering to allow IPv6 address ranges. We recommend that you update your IAM policies with your\norganization's IPv6 address ranges in addition to your existing IPv4 address ranges. For an example\nof a bucket policy that allows access over both IPv6 and IPv4, see Restrict access to specific IP\naddresses. You can review your IAM user policies using the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/\niam/. For more information about IAM, see the IAM User Guide. For information about editing S3\non Outposts bucket policies, see Adding or editing a bucket policy for an Amazon S3 on Outposts\nbucket. Testing IP address compatibility\nIf you're using a Linux or Unix instance, or macOS X platform, you can test your access to a dual-\nstack endpoint over IPv6. For example, to test the connection to Amazon S3 on Outposts endpoints\nover IPv6, use the dig command:\nTesting IP address compatibility API Version 2006-03-01 202\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\ndig s3-outposts.us-west-2.api.aws AAAA +short\nIf your dual-stack endpoint over an IPv6 network is properly set up, the dig command returns the\nconnected IPv6 addresses. For example:\ndig s3-outposts.us-west-2.api.aws AAAA +short\n2600:1f14:2588:4800:b3a9:1460:159f:ebce\n2600:1f14:2588:4802:6df6:c1fd:ef8a:fc76\n2600:1f14:2588:4801:d802:8ccf:4e04:817\nUsing IPv6 with AWS PrivateLink\nS3 on Outposts supports the IPv6 protocol for AWS PrivateLink services and endpoints. With AWS\nPrivateLink support for the IPv6 protocol, you can connect to service endpoints within your VPC\nover IPv6 networks, from either on-premises or other private connections. The IPv6 support for\nAWS PrivateLink for S3 on Outposts also allows you to integrate AWS PrivateLink with dual-stack\nendpoints. For steps on how to enable IPv6 for AWS PrivateLink, see Expedite your IPv6 adoption\nwith AWS PrivateLink services and endpoints. Note\nTo update the supported IP address type from IPv4 to IPv6, see Modify the supported IP\naddress type in the AWS PrivateLink User Guide. Using IPv6 with AWS PrivateLink\nIf you\u2019re using AWS PrivateLink with IPv6, you must create an IPv6 or dual-stack VPC interface\nendpoint. For general steps on how to create a VPC endpoint using the AWS Management Console,\nsee Access an AWS service using an interface VPC endpoint in the AWS PrivateLink User Guide. AWS Management Console\nUse the following procedure to create an interface VPC endpoint that connects to S3 on\nOutposts.

Using S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints\nS3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints support requests to S3 on Outposts buckets over IPv6 and\nIPv4. This section describes how to use S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints. Topics\n\u2022 S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints\n\u2022 Using dual-stack endpoints from the AWS CLI\n\u2022 Using S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints from the AWS SDKs\nS3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints\nWhen you make a request to a dual-stack endpoint, the S3 on Outposts bucket URL resolves to an\nIPv6 or an IPv4 address. For more information about accessing an S3 on Outposts bucket over IPv6,\nsee Making requests to S3 on Outposts over IPv6. To access an S3 on Outposts bucket through a dual-stack endpoint, use a path-style endpoint\nname. S3 on Outposts supports only Regional dual-stack endpoint names, which means that you\nmust specify the Region as part of the name. For a dual-stack path-style FIPs endpoint, use the following naming convention:\ns3-outposts-fips.region.api.aws\nFor dual-stack non-FIPS endpoint, use the following naming convention:\ns3-outposts.region.api.aws\nUsing dual-stack endpoints API Version 2006-03-01 206\n\nAmazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nNote\nVirtual hosted-style endpoint names aren't supported in S3 on Outposts. Using dual-stack endpoints from the AWS CLI\nThis section provides examples of AWS CLI commands used to make requests to a dual-stack\nendpoint. For instructions on setting up the AWS CLI, see Getting started by using the AWS CLI and\nSDK for Java. You set the configuration value use_dualstack_endpoint to true in a profile in your AWS\nConfig file to direct all Amazon S3 requests made by the s3 and s3api AWS CLI commands to the\ndual-stack endpoint for the specified Region. You specify the Region in the configuration file or in a\ncommand using the --region option. When using dual-stack endpoints with the AWS CLI, only path addressing style is supported. The addressing style, set in the configuration file, determines whether the bucket name is in the\nhostname or in the URL. For more information, see s3outposts in the AWS CLI User Guide. To use a dual-stack endpoint via the AWS CLI, use the --endpoint-url parameter with\nthe http://s3.dualstack.region.amazonaws.com or https://s3-outposts-\nfips.region.api.aws endpoint for any s3control or s3outposts commands. For example:\n$ aws s3control list-regional-buckets --endpoint-url https://s3-\noutposts.region.api.aws\nUsing S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints from the AWS SDKs\nThis section provides examples of how to access a dual-stack endpoint by using the AWS SDKs.
