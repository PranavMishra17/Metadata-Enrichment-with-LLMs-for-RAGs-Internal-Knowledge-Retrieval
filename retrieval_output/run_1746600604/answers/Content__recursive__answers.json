      "answer": "Based on the provided context, the key difference between Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier is their intended use and access patterns:\n\n1. **Amazon S3**: It is designed for frequent and infrequent access to objects, offering real-time access to data. It is suitable for active workloads like web applications, data analytics, and backups.\n\n2. **Amazon S3 Glacier**: It is primarily designed for archival storage, meaning data stored in Glacier is not available for real-time access. It is optimized for long-term storage at lower costs, with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours depending on the storage class (e.g., Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive).\n\nThe context does not provide further technical details or comparisons between S3 and Glacier.",

      "query": "How to restore files from Glacier",
      "answer": "To restore files from Amazon S3 Glacier, you can follow these steps based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Initiate an Archive Retrieval Job**:\n   - Use the AWS CLI or API to create a retrieval job for the archive you want to restore.\n   - You will need the `ArchiveId` of the file you want to retrieve. This can be obtained by downloading the vault inventory.\n\n2. **Wait for the Job to Complete**:\n   - Archive retrieval in S3 Glacier is not instantaneous and can take several hours depending on the retrieval options (e.g., standard, expedited, or bulk).\n\n3. **Download the Archive**:\n   - Once the job is complete, you can download the archive using the AWS CLI or API. The job output will provide the location of the restored archive.\n\n4. **Temporary Copy**:\n   - Restored files are available as temporary copies for a specified duration (defined in the restore request). Ensure you download or use the restored files within this time frame.\n\nFor detailed instructions, refer to the sections in the S3 Glacier Developer Guide related to archive retrieval and downloading archives using the AWS CLI.",

      "query": "S3 lifecycle configuration",
      "answer": "An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects within a bucket. These actions include:\n\n1. **Transition actions**: Moving objects to different storage classes, such as S3 Standard-IA, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, or S3 Glacier, based on their age or inactivity.\n2. **Expiration actions**: Deleting objects after a specified period.\n\nYou can configure S3 Lifecycle rules using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or the REST API. Additionally, you can add filters to target specific objects within a bucket and manage actions for both current and noncurrent object versions in version-enabled buckets.\n\nFor more detailed steps or examples, refer to the relevant sections in the Amazon S3 User Guide or API Reference.",

Follow the prompts to complete the vault creation process.\n\n### Using the AWS CLI:\nRun the following command:\n```bash\naws glacier create-vault --vault-name my-vault --account-id -\n```\n- Replace `my-vault` with the desired name for your vault.\n- The account ID argument can be replaced with a hyphen (`-`), which directs AWS to use the account ID associated with your credentials.\n\n### Using the REST API:\nSend an HTTP `PUT` request to the URI of the vault to be created:\n```http\nPUT /AccountId/vaults/VaultName HTTP/1.1\nHost: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com\n```\n- Replace `AccountId` with your AWS account ID.\n- Replace `VaultName` with the desired vault name.\n- Replace `Region` with the AWS Region where the vault will be created.\n\nFor more information, consult the Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide.",
