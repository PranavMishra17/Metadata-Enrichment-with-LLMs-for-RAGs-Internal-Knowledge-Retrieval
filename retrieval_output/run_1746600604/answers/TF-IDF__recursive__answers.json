      "query": "Difference between S3 and Glacier storage",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, the difference between Amazon S3 and Glacier storage can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Amazon S3**: Designed for general-purpose storage with real-time access to data. It offers multiple storage classes, such as S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA, which store data redundantly across geographically separated locations for high availability.\n\n- **Amazon Glacier**: Specifically designed for archival storage. Objects stored in Glacier are not available for real-time access and must be restored before use. Glacier storage classes, such as S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive, are optimized for long-term data retention at lower costs.\n\nIf more details are needed, they are not provided in the current context.",

Refer to the AWS CLI User Guide for setup instructions.\n\n2. **Retrieve Archive IDs**: To download your archives, you need to know the archive IDs. Steps 1-4 in the context mention retrieving archive IDs.\n\n3. **Initiate Archive Retrieval**: Use the `ArchiveRetrieval` action to request the restoration of an archive. This process involves specifying the `ArchiveId` and the vault name.\n\n4. **Download the Archive**: Once the retrieval job is complete, you can download the archive using the AWS CLI. Specific commands and examples are provided in the Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide.\n\nNote: During the restoration process, you will incur charges for both the archive storage and the temporary copy being restored.\n\nFor detailed commands and syntax, refer to the \"Downloading an Archive in Amazon S3 Glacier Using the AWS CLI\" section of the Developer Guide.",
